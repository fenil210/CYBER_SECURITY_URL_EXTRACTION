# Cyber Threat Detection Project

This project uses data extraction from URL, data pre-processing, and feature extraction to detect cyber threats and malicious conversations. It also uses Python Scary to crawl multiple URLs.

## Features

* Extracts data from URL.
* Performs data pre-processing.
* Extracts features from data.
* Detects cyber threats and malicious conversations.
* Crawl multiple URLs using Python Scary.

## Usage
